\section{Milestones} \label{Milestones}
Four milestones were proposed at the beginning of the project. They were taken from the project outline and include three programming milestones and one documentation milestone. The first one was the implementation of the overview of difference between plan and tracking, followed by the application status display. The final programming milestone was composed of the import and export as well as the creation of plan projects. After this the documentation had to be finalized. These milestones were meant as a guideline to see if the progress is adequate or if we had to rethink our approach. Those milestones were created and managed in GitHub (see chapter \ref{GitHub}).
