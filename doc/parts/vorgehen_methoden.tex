\section{Organization Methodology}
For this project a reduced and modified version of SCRUM \cite{scrum_url} was chosen. The modifications include reducing the daily SCRUM meetings to two to three meetings a week, as we did not work on the project full time. One of these meetings was also attended by our project advisor Mr. Feisthammel. This meeting was usually held on Tuesday morning. There, a short progress report as well as the next weekly goals were discussed. Milestones as described in chapter \ref{Milestones} have been defined. They roughly correspond with the two-week sprint plan. An additional reduction is the absence of a sprint review as we do something similar in the weekly meetings described above. The point system as well as the burn down chart were also dropped.
