\section{Organization Methodology}
For this project a reduced and modified version of SCRUM \cite{scrum_url} was chosen. This modifications include only two to three meetings a week, as we do not work on the project full time. This meetings include a meeting with our project advisor Mister Feisthammel. In this meetings a short progress report as well as the goal for the following week are discussed. Milestones as described in chapter \ref{Milestones} have been included and correspond roughly with the two week sprint plan. An additional reduction is the absence of a sprint review as we do something similar in the weekly meetings described above. The point system as well as the burn down chart were also dropped.
