\section{Milestones}
Four milestones were planned at the beginning of the project. They were taken from the project outline and include three programming milestones and one documentation milestone. The first one being the implementation of the overview of difference between plan and tracking. Followed by displaying the application status and as the final programming milestone the import and export as well as the creation of plan projects. After this the documentation has to be finalized. These milestones are meant as a guideline to see if the progress is adequate or if we have to rethink our approach. Those milestones were created and managed in Github (see chapter \ref{Github})
