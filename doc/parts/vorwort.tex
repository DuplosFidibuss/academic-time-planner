This semester thesis was written by Markus Ferber and Lukas Jans in the fifth semester of their bachelor's degree in computer science at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences ZHAW in Winterthur. The authors would like to thank their supervisor, Patrick Feisthammel, as well as their additional advisor, Prof. Dr. Karl Rege, for their helpful advice and support throughout the realization of the thesis. They would also like to thank Mrs. Angelika Langham for her review of the thesis and her helpful remarks regarding the use of English language.\\
