\section{GitHub} \label{GitHub}
GitHub \cite{github_url} is an inline service which provides Git based version control for software projects.
\subsection{Version control}
Version control is used to see what was changed when and by whom. It can also be used to roll back to an older state if needed. In GitHub a feature branch is created to implement a certain feature, and afterwards when finished such a branch will be integrated into the main branch via a pull request. This pull request allows the other members of the team to request changes before the branch is merged into the main branch. This process also enables members of a team to work independently without the problem of accidentally interfering with an other team member's work.
\subsection{GitHub Actions}
GitHub Actions is a (CI/CD) platform \cite{github_actions_url}. It allows build and test automation as well as a deployment pipeline. It allows the creation of workflows to automatically test and build every pull request. This feature helps to prevent the accidental inclusion of broken features or features which are in themselves functional but would break other parts of the project.
\subsection{GitHub Issues}
Issues are often related to features and the corresponding feature branches. They allow to break down a milestone into manageable tasks which can then be distributed to the members of the team to work on. This permits the other members to see, if someone is working on a task and who is in charge of it.
