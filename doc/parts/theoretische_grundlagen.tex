\section{Toggl Track}
Toggl Track is an easy-to-use, multifunctional online time tracking application. Tasks can be tracked and grouped
into projects. Tracking can be started and stopped using start and stop buttons. Times can also be manually entered
and assigned to a task and a project. Toggl Track offers many additional functionalities including automatic recognition 
of working time, generation of detailed reports and distinction between billable and non-billable time. Toggl Track can 
be used on different platforms like computers, smartphones and tablets. The tracking data is then synchronized between the 
devices. Furthermore, Toggl Track provides an API to be used to query tracked time entries from Toggl Track which can then
be used outside Toggl Track itself, e. g. by other applications. \cite{bachelorarbeit_Egger_Verstappen_page8}
