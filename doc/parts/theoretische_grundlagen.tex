\section{GitHub} \label{GitHub}
GitHub \cite{github_url} is an inline service which provides Git based version control for software projects.
\subsection{Version control}
Version control is used to see what was changed when and by whom. It can also be used to roll back to an older state if needed. In GitHub a feature branch is created to implement a certain feature, and afterwards when finished such a branch will be integrated into the main branch via a pull request. This pull request allows the other members of the team to request changes before the branch is merged into the main branch. This process also allows members of a team to work independently without the problem of accidentally interfering with an other team member's work.
