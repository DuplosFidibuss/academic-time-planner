\section{Architectural overview} \label{Architecture}
In this section the software architecture of the ATP is shown as realized.

\subsection{Packages}
The following packages form the architecture of the ATP:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Pages: pages of the UI and their controller code
	\item Shared: common parts of the pages and their controller code
	\item UIModels: helper classes needed by the pages to map entry form elements to
	\item Services: classes providing functionality to fetch data from Toggl or Local Storage, being provided to other classes via dependency injection
	\item Store: classes managed by Fluxor to handle user inputs from and provide outputs to the pages, using services for data fetching
	\item DataManagement: business logic managing application data, made persistent by being saved in Local Storage
	\item Data: consists of ApplicationData (classes modelling planning and Toggl data), DisplayData (planning and Toggl data as used by the UI) and MetaData (additional data used by the ATP, e.g. Toggl credentials).
	\item JSONHandling: helper classes for JSON data handling (used in tests and by Local Storage)
\end{itemize}
The Program.cs file is the entry point of the system where the application is set up and run. \_Imports.razor, App.razor and wwwroot contain global application settings. The packages and their relations are shown in figure \ref{architecture_overview}. Packages containing UI functionality are marked blue, packages managed by external frameworks are marked violet, services are marked orange, business logic is marked green, and data packages are marked red.
\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Architecture_overview}
	\caption{Architectural overview}
	\label{architecture_overview}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Mapping concept} \label{Mapping_result}
Upon closer inspection it became apparent that only four of the plan classes and two of the Toggl classes were needed. The Toggl tasks are currently only a dictionary inside the TogglProject class and not a class in their own right. The Budget classes were implemented differently as a feature of the plan projects. Each plan project keeps the Toggl projects linked to it with their share of time. The share of time for a Toggl project is calculated as follows:
\begin{equation*}
	Share \, of \, time = \frac{Total \, time \, of \, plan \, project}{Sum \, of \, total \, times \, of \, all \, plan \, projects \, linked \, to \, Toggl \, project}
\end{equation*}
With all these modifications the class diagram of the mapping concept was slimmed down as seen in figure \ref{classdiagram_prototype_current}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{classdiagram_prototype_current}
	\caption{Class diagram of the new mapping concept}
	\label{classdiagram_prototype_current}
\end{figure}

\section{Application data persistence with LocalStorage}
The approach described in chapter \ref{Local Storage} was applied to store application data (plan project data, data fetched from Toggl etc.). The data is held by a data manager object which is stored in LocalStorage and can be loaded from there using the interface provided by the LocalStorage library.

\section{Overview PlanProject vs TogglProject} \label{Graphical overview}
Three different charts are displayed in the charts tab to display the difference between the plan projects and the corresponding Toggl projects.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Total overview
	\item Projects overview
	\item Project time range overview
\end{itemize}
The different charts are explained in more detail in the following subsections.

\subsection{Total Overview}
This bar chart shows the overall sum of the time planned for all plan projects compared to the total tracked time of their associated Toggl projects. Additionally, a prediction of how much time will be needed according to the future plan entries is displayed. An example for two projects is shown in figure \ref{totalOverview}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{TotalOverview}
	\caption{Total overview for all projects}
	\label{totalOverview}
\end{figure}
If all projects have been completed already meaning there are no future plan entries for any project then no prediction will be displayed. An example for one project is shown in figure \ref{totalOverviewFinished}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{TotalOverview_FinishedProject}
	\caption{Total overview for one finished project}
	\label{totalOverviewFinished}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Projects Overview}
This bar chart is similar to the total overview but the single projects are displayed separately. Another minor difference is that the prognosis is added to both the tracked time and the planned time creating a prediction for both. The prediction is calculated by subtracting the time planned until today from the total planned time. Time planned until today is calculated by summing up all entries with start dates in the past. Currently running entries are added by percentage (e.g. in a week long entry beginning at Monday, Friday would be approximately 71.43\%). An example for two projects is shown in figure \ref{projectOverview}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{ProjectOverview}
	\caption{Project overview for two projects}
	\label{projectOverview}
\end{figure}
If a project has been completed already meaning there are no future plan entries for it then no prediction will be displayed for that project. An example for one project is shown in figure \ref{projectOverviewFinished}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{ProjectOverview_FinishedProject}
	\caption{Project overview for one finished project}
	\label{projectOverviewFinished}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Project time range overview}
An applicable time range has to be chosen to display the chart. On hitting the "Set filter" button the time range is set and a line chart is drawn for every project, showing the development of planned time and tracked time during the selected time range. The "Reset filter" button deletes the charts and reopens the filter options. This chart allows to see how the time amounts displayed in the other charts have been achieved and thus enables a user to estimate the quality of their planning. An example for one project is shown in figure \ref{timeOverview}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{TimeOverview}
	\caption{Time overview for one project}
	\label{timeOverview}
\end{figure}

\section{Application status display and synchronization} \label{Status display}
A Blazor page for synchronization with Toggl had already been added in the original prototype. The modal entry mask was replaced by Blazor input components as described in chapter \ref{JS replacement} (see figure \ref{Toggl page initial}). When the "Save Toggl settings" button is clicked the credentials entered in the text fields are saved using Local Storage (see chapter \ref{Local Storage}) and a first synchronization request is sent to Toggl. If one or both fields are left empty, appropriate error messages are displayed (see figure \ref{Toggl page validation}). After successful synchronization, the entry fields and the save button are replaced by a "Synchronize" button in order to allow users to re-synchronize the ATP with Toggl at any time and not just on entering the Toggl credentials. A label next to the button indicates the time of the last synchronization. An overview of the loaded data and their associations with the ATP planning data is displayed below the button (see figure \ref{Toggl associated}). If a Toggl project has no associations yet it is indicated in the load overview (see figure \ref{Toggl loaded}). Entries which do not belong to a Toggl project are displayed as belonging to "Entries without project" (see figure \ref{Toggl no project}). Internally, these entries are saved in a project having this name. Toggl projects which have been deleted in Toggl, but are still present in the ATP, are marked as deleted (see figure \ref{Toggl deleted}). They will be present in the ATP until Local Storage is cleared (e.g., when the browser cache is cleared).

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{Toggl_init}
	\caption{Toggl page with no Toggl projects loaded prior to synchronization}

\end{figure}

\section{Front-end of import, export, creation and editing of plan projects}
The following subsections describe the front-end for import, export and creation of a plan project.

\subsection{Import front-end}
 The user has to click on the "Browse..." button to import a project (see figure \ref{importButton}). Doing so opens a window where the user can select the projects to be loaded (see figure \ref{importWindow}). If a project already exists in the ATP it will be overwritten with the new data otherwise the plan project is added to the ATP. All loaded plan projects are displayed in a list (see figure \ref{loadedPlanProjects}).
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{ImportButton}
	\caption{Button to browse files for import}
	\label{importButton}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\columnwidth]{ImportProjectWindow}
	\caption{Window to select files for import}
	\label{importWindow}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{LoadedPlanProjectsList}
	\caption{List of loaded plan projects}
	\label{loadedPlanProjects}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Export front-end}
The user has to click on the "Download" button next to a plan project to export it (see figure \ref{downloadButton}). This will open the browser's download options like "Save as..." or "Open with...".
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{DownloadButton}
	\caption{Download button}
	\label{downloadButton}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Create plan project front-end}
The user has to click on the "Create plan project" button to create a plan project (see figure \ref{createPlanProjectButton}). 
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{CreatePlanProjectButton}
	\caption{Button to start creating a plan project}
	\label{createPlanProjectButton}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Create plan project and plan task}
On the following page the user has to enter the name of the plan project (see figure \ref{createPlanProject}). Not doing so will result in an error on the final overview page before finalizing the project (see figure \ref{createFinalOverviewError}). The next page allows the user to create plan tasks by entering a name and clicking on the "Create task" button (see figure \ref{createPlanTask}). A user can create multiple tasks if desired. This step is optional and the tasks are not needed for the project to function.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{CreatePlanProject}
	\caption{Naming of the plan project}
	\label{createPlanProject}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{CreatePlanTask}
	\caption{Creating plan tasks}
	\label{createPlanTask}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Plan Entries and Plan Entry Repetitions}
On this page the user can choose to create a single plan entry or a plan entry repetition (see figure \ref{createRepetitionOrEntry}). It is possible to create multiples of both and they can be mixed.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{CreateRepetitionOrEntry}
	\caption{Choosing if a single plan entry or a repetition entry should be created}
	\label{createRepetitionOrEntry}
\end{figure}
To create a plan entry all the listed criteria (see figure \ref{createPlanEntry}) have to be met otherwise the create plan entry button will not create a plan entry. If plan tasks were created earlier, a task can be linked to the entry. This step is optional as well. All created plan entries are listed in a list and can be deleted if needed (see figure \ref{createPlanEntry_List}). After creating a plan entry the user can either create another one or click "Next" to save them and go to the previous page to either create repetition entries, go to finalize or to go back and create tasks.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{CreatePlanEntry}
	\caption{Creating a plan entry}
	\label{createPlanEntry}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{CreatePlanEntry_List}
	\caption{List of created plan entries}
	\label{createPlanEntry_List}
\end{figure}
The creation of a plan entry repetition works similar to the creation of a plan entry. It creates multiple plan entries that repeat after a given interval. The time investment will be distributed evenly over the whole interval by default. If this is not desired then a time span can be entered which starts at the start of an interval. All criteria are listed for the user to check (see \ref{createRepetitionEntry}).
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{CreateRepetitionEntry}
	\caption{Creating a plan entry repetition}
	\label{createRepetitionEntry}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Final overview}
On this last page the user can check if all the tasks, plan entries and repetition entries were created (see \ref{createFinalOverview}). If not, the user can go back and create them and in the case of the previously mentioned missing plan project name the aforementioned error will show (see figure \ref{createFinalOverviewError}). If everything is in order, the user can click on "Finish" to create the plan project and will be brought back to the initial overview of the projects where the newly created project will be added to the list (see figure \ref{loadedPlanProjects}).
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{CreateFinalOverview}
	\caption{Final overview of the plan project}
	\label{createFinalOverview}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{CreateFinalOverviewError}
	\caption{Error message if the plan project was not named}
	\label{createFinalOverviewError}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Edit plan project front-end}
To edit a plan project the user can click on the "Edit" button next to a project in the list (see \ref{editButton}). This will open a similar view as the "Create plan project" button. The only difference being that all the data of the plan project are already entered.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{EditButton}
	\caption{Button to start editing process of a plan project}
	\label{editButton}
\end{figure}

\section{Linking of plan projects and Toggl projects} \label{Linking}
The linking page lists the plan projects and the Toggl projects that are present in the ATP as radio buttons. In order to link a Toggl project to a plan project, the user has to select the two and click on "Link projects". An overview of the projects that have already been linked is displayed below the buttons (see figure \ref{Linking init}). It is possible to link the same Toggl project to different plan projects. It is also possible to link multiple Toggl projects to one single plan project. To do this the user just has to select the same plan project once again and link it to the Toggl project of their choice (see figure \ref{Linking multiple}).

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{Linking_1}
	\caption{Linking page}
	\label{Linking init}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{Linking_2}
	\caption{Linking page with multiple Toggl projects linked to one plan project}
	\label{Linking multiple}
\end{figure}

In order to link plan tasks of a plan project to Toggl tasks of the associated Toggl project(s) the user has to click on "Link tasks" which opens up the according submenu which looks similar to the project linking menu and works in just the same way (see figure \ref{Linking tasks init}). In the overview of the linked tasks the Toggl project to which a Toggl task belongs is indicated in brackets. Again, it is possible to link multiple Toggl tasks to one single plan task (see figure \ref{Linking tasks multiple}) and also to link one Toggl tasks to different plan tasks. By clicking on "Link projects" the user can switch back to the project linking menu.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{Linking_tasks1}
	\caption{Task linking}
	\label{Linking tasks init}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{Linking_tasks2}
	\caption{Task linking with multiple Toggl tasks linked to one plan task}
	\label{Linking tasks multiple}
\end{figure}

\section{Concurrent behavior}
In case multiple tabs are opened the application behavior is conservative. This means that if two tabs are opened and a plan project is deleted in one of them while being edited in the other one, finishing the edit after deletion saves the edited project. Therefore, it will be present again in the first tab after reload.
